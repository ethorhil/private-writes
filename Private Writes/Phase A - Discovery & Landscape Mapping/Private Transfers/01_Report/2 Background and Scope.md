## **2.1 Purpose of the Private Transfers Track**

The **Private Transfers** track investigates how users can move value privately on Ethereum and adjacent systems. Private transfers are a foundational building block for user protection, commercial use cases, institutional adoption, and compliant on-chain finance.

Yet, unlike public transfers—where designs converge on a shared set of primitives—the privacy landscape is diverse, fragmented, and driven by different assumptions about data availability, trust, programmability, and identity. This diversity makes it difficult for protocol teams, builders, and researchers to speak a common language about “how private transfers work” and where the main structural bottlenecks lie.

Phase A responds to this need by producing a **clear overview** of:
- the major mechanism families that support private value movement,
- how they differ in guarantees and costs,
- where they share common failure modes, and
- how the ecosystem is distributed across these mechanism types.

The goal is not to decide which pattern is “best,” but to map the field.

## **2.2 What This Report Covers (Phase A Boundaries)**

Phase A is deliberately **descriptive**.  
It aims to:

- Define the **seven canonical private-transfer patterns** used throughout the ecosystem.
- Explain the **taxonomy** that distinguishes them.
- Compare patterns using a **frozen, maturity-weighted scoring framework**.
- Describe the **cross-pattern problems** that affect multiple approaches.
- Introduce the **ecosystem landscape** and where current projects fit.
- Provide a **common vocabulary** for teams thinking about private transfers.

Phase A does **not**:
- Recommend which patterns PSE should focus on.
- Rank patterns by strategic importance.
- Speculate on future technical breakthroughs.
- Perform any prioritization.

Any instruction or interpretation requiring those actions is out of scope and must be handled in **Phase B**.
