**Pattern:** [[Private Rollups (Full DA)]]

**Type:** ZK‑Optimistic rollup for private multi‑asset payments and swaps (research prototype).  
**State model:** UTXO‑based shielded notes with commitments and nullifiers; supports ETH, ERC‑20s, and NFTs.  
**DA model:** Full L1 DA – encrypted tx data included in Ethereum calldata for each batch (true rollup).  
**Selective disclosure:** None built‑in – strong default privacy; no view‑key or auditor‑key system, only voluntary off‑chain reveal.  
**Readiness:** Alpha‑stage research implementation; Görli testnet + experimental mainnet attempt, now inactive.
