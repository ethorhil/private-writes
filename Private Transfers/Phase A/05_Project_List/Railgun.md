**Pattern:** [[L1 Shielded Pools]]

**Type:** Smart-contract–based multi-asset shielded pool with private transfers and private DeFi via Adapt modules  
**State model:** UTXO-style encrypted notes + nullifiers; supports multi-input/multi-output join–split proofs across ERC-20s and NFTs  
**DA model:** Full L1 DA (all encrypted commitments, nullifiers, and proof verifications posted to Ethereum)  
**Selective disclosure:** Yes — viewing keys for auditors; optional “proof-of-innocence” showing transactions do not involve blacklisted addresses  
**Readiness:** Production; multi-chain deployments (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, BSC); audited; >$2B cumulative private volume
