## [[Phase A – Private Transfers Landscape|Phase A – Discovery & Landscape Mapping]]

We map the current ecosystem of private-transfer mechanisms, build a simple taxonomy, and compare the main patterns (overlays, shielded pools, burn‑and‑mint, private rollups, etc.) across shared metrics like privacy strength, L1 cost, throughput, UX, and trust assumptions. The output is a shared factual baseline plus a “problem radar” of recurring structural challenges.
### If you're not sure where to start

- **If you’re totally new to Private Transfers:** Skim [[1 Summary]] for a narrative overview and key takeaways from Phase A.
- **If you want the detailed landscape and patterns:** Go to [[Phase A – Private Transfers Landscape]] and follow links into the Phase A reports (taxonomy, pattern overview, metrics, and problems).


## Phase B – Focus & Prototyping

We turn the Phase A map into a shortlist of concrete opportunities. This phase selects which structural problems to prioritize, which patterns best fit PSE’s capabilities. It also aligns private transfers with adjacent tracks (identity, private reads, etc.) and defines the benchmarks and measurement plan we’ll use to judge progress.

## Phase C – Implementation & Ecosystem Work

Take Phase B opportunities to the next step.
