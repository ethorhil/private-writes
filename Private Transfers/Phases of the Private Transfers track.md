## Phase A – Discovery & Landscape Mapping

We map the current ecosystem of private-transfer mechanisms, build a simple taxonomy, and compare the main patterns (overlays, shielded pools, burn‑and‑mint, private rollups, etc.) across shared metrics like privacy strength, L1 cost, throughput, UX, and trust assumptions. The output is a shared factual baseline plus a “problem radar” of recurring structural challenges, without yet picking winners or making investment decisions.

## Phase B – Focus & Prototyping

We turn the Phase A map into a shortlist of concrete opportunities. This phase selects which structural problems to prioritize, which patterns best fit PSE’s capabilities, and what prototypes or experiments will be most informative. It also aligns private transfers with adjacent tracks (identity, ordering privacy, etc.) and defines the benchmarks and measurement plan we’ll use to judge progress.

## Phase C – Implementation & Ecosystem Work

We double‑down on the most promising Phase B bets and push them into the real world: specs, reference implementations, collaborations with external teams, audits, documentation, and long‑lived maintenance where it makes sense. The aim is to turn research and prototypes into durable improvements for users and the broader Ethereum privacy ecosystem, and to feed real‑world feedback back into the map and problem radar.
