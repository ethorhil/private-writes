## [[Phase A Index|Phase A – Discovery & Landscape Mapping]]

We map the current ecosystem of private-transfer mechanisms, build a simple taxonomy, and compare the main patterns (overlays, shielded pools, burn‑and‑mint, private rollups, etc.) across shared metrics like privacy strength, L1 cost, throughput, UX, and trust assumptions. The output is a shared factual baseline plus a “problem radar” of recurring structural challenges.

## Phase B – Focus & Prototyping

We turn the Phase A map into a shortlist of concrete opportunities. This phase selects which structural problems to prioritize, which patterns best fit PSE’s capabilities. It also aligns private transfers with adjacent tracks (identity, private reads, etc.) and defines the benchmarks and measurement plan we’ll use to judge progress.

## Phase C – Implementation & Ecosystem Work

We double‑down on the most promising Phase B bets and push them into the real world: specs, reference implementations, collaborations with external teams, audits, documentation, and long‑lived maintenance where it makes sense.
