This vault holds my long‑term research on on‑chain privacy systems.
 
 - [Published vault](https://publish.obsidian.md/private-writes)
 - [Github page](https://github.com/ethorhil/private-writes) (for contributions)
## Tracks

- `private-transers/`
  - `phase-a/` — Phase A *mapping & diagnosis* for private transfers  
    (taxonomy, seven patterns, comparison table, problem radar, final report)
  - `phase-b/` — Phase B *problem selection & experiments* (to be added)
  - `phase-c/` — Phase C *Execution planning* (to be added)

- `private-defi/` — Private DeFi + composability work (planned)

## How to Use This Vault

1. Start in `private-transers/phase-a` for landscape mapping of private transfers  
   (patterns, metrics, and cross‑pattern problems)
2. As new phases/tracks spin up, i will mirror this structure: `track/phase-x/...`.
3. Treat this root README as the entry point; each subfolder should have its own local README.
